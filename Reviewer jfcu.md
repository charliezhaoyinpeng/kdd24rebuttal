**[W1]** A practical application of our work lies in automated hiring systems. In such systems, a learned model can make hiring decisions for employment candidates on behalf of a company, irrespective of sensitive information such as race. For instance, an automated hiring system can be trained using historical data collected from various geographical regions. Each data sample represents a candidate with multiple features, including age, race, education levels, past working experience, and so on. However, distributions of these data features may differ across regions (covariate shift), and the correlations between predicted outcomes (whether to extend a job offer or not) and sensitive attributes (such as race) may also vary across regions (dependence shift). In this scenario, our proposed approach aims to develop a fairness-aware classifier capable of generalizing from data sampled from given geographical regions to unknown ones while simultaneously addressing potential covariate and dependence shifts.

**[W2, Q2]** To analyze the complexity of Algorithm 1, we initially address the complexity of learning the transformation model $T$. According to Algorithm 2 in the appendix, the complexity of learning $T$ is expressed as $O(n \cdot q \cdot p)$, where $n$ stands for the number of epochs, $q$ represents the number of batches, and $p$ signifies the number of iterations of the optimizer Adam. In Algorithm 1, the transformation model is employed to produce samples in synthetic domains. The complexity of Algorithm 1 can be defined as $O(t \cdot m \cdot (h + p))$, where $t$ denotes the number of epochs, $m$ indicates the number of batches, $h$ signifies the number of samples generated through $T$, and $p$ represents the number of iterations of Adam.
